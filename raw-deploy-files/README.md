# What's `raw-deploy-files` for?
Temporary fix for deployment services like Netlify and Vercel.
This file enables drag-and-drop into these services for straightforward deployment instead of running Github repo directly.

## Issue
I cannot directly run dev environment on Netlify and Vercel production servers.
